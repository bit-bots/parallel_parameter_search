Distributed Parameter Learning
=====================================

This package allows you to optimize a generic set of parameters for an arbitrary algorithm in a distributed way in the Pybullet and Webots simulator.
The package heavly relies on Optuna as a backend for optimization and for distributed execution via SQL database.
